# Mini Java Compiler

This project consists of creating a Mini Java compiler.

Currently, me and my partner [Chaima Akkari](https://github.com/chaimakr) finished the _Lexical and Syntax Analyser_ using __Flex__ and __YACC__.

Plus, we provided a small Desktop app using .NET's WPF where you can write your code there and compile in the same place.

## Process

In the _MiniJavaCompiler_ directory, you will find a ``.bat`` file that generates and executable - which is our parser.

That parser is used by the Desktop app to run the parsing process  while showing the output of that executable.
